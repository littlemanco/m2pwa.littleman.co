Project Outline
----------------

Magneto provides a reasonable REST API. Recently, offline first web applications (or PWAs) have become a thing. "Offline First" seems like a super conceptual model to build a web application, and an e-commerce store seems like a suitable thing to make an application. 

The site I'm going to build is a psuedo martial arts website, as I'm pretty into a martial art called "Muay Thai", and it's something I know a little about.

Project Goals
'''''''''''''

- Provide a super minimal, functional PWA Magento store with the Polymer PWA toolbox.
- Help me learn Polymer

- Help me learn PWAs
